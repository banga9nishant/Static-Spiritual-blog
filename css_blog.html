	<h2>Praying and Working</h2>
	<div>The first part of the saying says that we should pray as if no work would help. In this kind of prayer, we are focusing all our attention in God. All our being is immersed in the prayer. It is as if we become the prayer itself. When we pray with such intensity and single-mindedness, God cannot ignore us.  </div>

	<p>There is another saying, “God hears the sincere cry of an ant sooner than the trumpeting of an elephant.” This saying is instructing us that if we have a deep prayer for something, we should pray with our whole heart, soul, and mind as if no work would help us achieve what we want, and our prayer will certainly bear fruit. </p>

	<p>God knows when we are in pain and we truly want help. But if we are merely half-hearted in our prayer, then God might or might not respond. That is why it is said that when a seeker is truly yearning for God, God hears it and will help that seeker find a way back to God.</p>
